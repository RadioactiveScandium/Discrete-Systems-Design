# Discrete-Systems-Design
DIY circuit design and simulation using discrete components such as transistors, ICs, R-L-C etc. May be extended to PCB implementation in the future.

For example, creating frequency divider using multivibrator circuits, display a moving data on LCD panel by controlling using an Arduino etc.
